# SPA-orders-app

It is a single page application which provides manipulation of orders. Every order has some fields as shipping info, customer info, map and list of products. Application allows add new orders and products, edit information about shipping, remove orders and products. Also there is possibility to add order to bookmark (allow to return to opened order state via URL).

To create this app I used native js with DOM manipulation and ajax with Promises for async calls. As a data source I used the local backend API server. This app bases on MVC design pattern.
